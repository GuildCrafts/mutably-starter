Input your pokemon name and number, as well as what it evolved from.

Because all pokemon look the same, your photo is automatically added to the collection based on the proper spelling of the pokemon you are entering. It is vitally important that your initial pokemon entry have the name spelled correctly if you want the photo. A pokemon can be nicknamed, but the evolved from, photo, and pokedex number are considered static since they generally can't change.

Any individual pokemon can be released, all you have to do is click the red button to the right.
